All code performs as it should and all tasks were completed in the manner that the lab intructions demand.

Part 1 analysis: Since the T(n)/(n*n) is continuously decreasing and T(n)/(nlogn) is converging closely to a constant, the sorting
method works more similarily to O(nlogn).

Part 2 analysis: Through trial and error, we determined that for Unique1 to take 60 seconds to complete an array of length 700 000, while 
Unique2, which is significantly more efficent, can handle array sizes all the way up until 500 000 000 before it finally takes 60 seconds.
